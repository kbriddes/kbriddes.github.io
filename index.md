## Something is wrong

For some reason I had to edit index.md to get to this. I don't know how to show the post or link it correctly.

Is there a way to fix this? The stuff after this is all filler from **index.md**  

Is it because this is the master branch? That makes sense.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
