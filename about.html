            <p><br>GAIA is a subscription for anyone with feminine needs. When it’s your time of the month, you get products on hand. However, there are those less fortunate who don’t have access to these products. That’s where GAIA comes in.<br><br>
Back in 2015, Cher and Kris visited New York City for the first time. They were shocked to find that almost 30% of homeless people are women, meaning these women don’t have access to feminine products. That’s where GAIA comes in. With GAIA, you can help these homeless women by helping yourself!</p>

            <p><br>We here at GAIA want to thank you for ordering our top of the line product to help those who are less fortunate. Financial inequity has made it impossible for women to get the products they need, but with GAIA you give to those who need it most. So from the bottom of our heart… thank you! </p>
