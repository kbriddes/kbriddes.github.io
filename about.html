            <p><br>GAIA is a subscription for anyone with feminine needs. When it’s your time of the month, you get products on hand. YOU are not alone though; there are those less fortunate who don’t have access to these products. That’s where GAIA comes in.<br><br>
Cher and Kris introduced GAIA back in 2018. Cher Tracy was a Marketing major out of Penn State who moved to New York after graduation. Kris Bauham was a biochemistry graduate who was working at a coffee shop in NYC. After a fate encounter between them at the coffee shop, a friendship quickly blossomed. Then, after living in New York for a few years, they realized there were many homeless women on the streets. They were shocked to find that almost 30% of homeless people are women, meaning hundreds of thousands of women don’t have access to feminine products. That’s where GAIA came in. With a bit of planning, work, and borrowing money from their parents, Cher and Kris came with GAIA -- another name for Mother Earth. With GAIA, you can donate to homeless women by helping yourself!</p>

            <p>We here at GAIA want to thank you for ordering our top of the line product to help those who are less fortunate. Financial inequity has made it impossible for women to get the products they need, but with GAIA you give to those who need it most. So from the bottom of our heart… thank you! </p>
